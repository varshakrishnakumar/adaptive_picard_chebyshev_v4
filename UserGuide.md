## Overview

This	algorithm	propagates	orbits	in	the	perturbed	two-body	environment	using	automated	and	
adaptive	tuning	of	segments	and	Chebyshev	polynomial	degree.	The	code	has	the	following	
capability:

1.	Automated	segmentation &	polynomial degree	scheme
2.	Loads	precomputed	matrices	for	desired	N
3.	Warm	&	Hot	starts
4.	Radially	adaptive	gravity
5.	Variable	fidelity	force	model
6.	Quasilinearization	error	feedback
7.	Reosculate	Keplerian	perigee	after	each	orbit
8.	Interpolation

A	test	case	is	presented	the	demonstrates	how	the	algorithm	is	run.	Edit	 **_test.cpp_** to	set	different	
initial	conditions,	propagation	time	and	spherical	harmonic	gravity	degree.

    **_>>	make	matrix_builder_**
2. Perform	the	one	time	build	of	the	constant	Picard-Chebyshev	matrices	from	within	/src
    **_>>	./matrix_builder_**
3. Compile	the	propagator	from	within	/src
    **_>>	make_**
4. Propagate	the	test	case	orbit	from	within	/src
    **_>>	./test_**
